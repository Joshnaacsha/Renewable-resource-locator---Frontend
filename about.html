      <h2>About VORTEX - Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Vortex was born from a shared passion for sustainability and a vision to
        revolutionize how companies approach renewable energy. As entrepreneurs,
        we, a group of five pre-final year CSE students— Gibson, Mithra Y,
        Joshna Acsha S, Prigangshu Chakraborty, and Ricky Davidson—embarked on
        this journey with a groundbreaking idea. Our mission is to connect
        companies with optimal locations for renewable energy projects,
        providing solutions that are not only beneficial but also sustainable
        for the environment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to empower businesses to make environmentally conscious
        choices while maximizing their return on investment. We believe in
        harnessing the power of data science to guide companies in locating and
        implementing renewable energy solutions efficiently.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        By leveraging Vortex, companies not only contribute to a greener future
        but also ensure the sustainability of their operations. Our platform
        assists in identifying the most suitable locations for solar farms,
        windmills, hydropower stations, and more, allowing businesses to make
        informed and sustainable decisions.
